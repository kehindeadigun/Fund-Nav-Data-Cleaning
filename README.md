# nav-sheets
This repository contains a project for cleaning some messy weekly stock information over a ten year period for use testing and developing an algorithm.

It consists of:
1) The Monify and Nav sheet notebooks contains our early attempts at cleaning the data.
2) The zipped Nav file contains the early data. Zipped is a series of csv's with fund information.
